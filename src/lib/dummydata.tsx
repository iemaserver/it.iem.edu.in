As loT devices become deeply integrated
into smart homes, industries, healthcare,
transportation, and city infrastructure,
securing these interconnected systems
becomes a top priority. This FDP aims to
bridge the gap between academia and
emerging industrial needs by focusing on
both
foundational
concepts

Our IEM KABADDI team fought with everything they had at the MAGNUS inter-college tournament held at BBIT & JIMS College and secured 1st Runner-Up with just a small margin of points! 🥈  

Team led by the young enthusiast Rudraksh Rana and every single player gave their all, leaving everything on the field. The spirit, passion, and teamwork were unmatched.  

While the victory slipped away by a narrow margin, this journey has fueled our drive to come back stronger and more determined.

    desc: `Ahhhhh still stucked … don’t know what to say,  
Sangram sports fest at UEM Jaipur had its challenges, especially with allegations of unfair play. Despite the tough conditions and questionable practices, IEM Kolkata's achievement of securing(🥉) 3rd place with 2 main players (Abhishek Yadav and Pradum Kumar Pandey) injured is commendable.  

It demonstrates resilience and determination in the face of adversity. It’s unfortunate that the spirit of sportsmanship was overshadowed by these issues, but IEM Kolkata's performance is a testament to their skill and teamwork.  

It’s tough to come so close and not get the gold, but earning bronze is still a significant achievement. It shows our hard work and dedication. With determination, we’ll definitely have another chance to aim for gold next time. Keep pushing us forward!  

I would like to apologise for this season to my IEM family (@iemgroup_) that we didn't win gold, but we will definitely come back stronger next season. ❤️💫 🥉`,
